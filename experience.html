				<h3 class="full-time-t">Software devolpment</h3>
				<p class="full-time-c">I am working towards my level 5 EQF in Full Stack development. Prior to this I
					independently commenced learning about HTML5 and CSS3 by following You tube videos and using
					textbooks which I acquired from amazon. On feeling more confident in this area I then went on to
					purchase the Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele which enabled me to learn and practice HTML and
					CSS in more detail. Following on from this I commenced using his Modern JavaScript Bootcamp, in
					order to become more competent in JavaScript, It was at this point I joined the Code Institute
					Course. This would enable me to not only gain a qualification in the industry, but also give me the
					tuition and feedback required in order to improve my knowledge and discover where I am making
					mistakes.

						<p class="full-time-c">I have been working as an instructor for over 3 years at Marwell Activity
							Centre. My roles and responsibilities here were many and varied. I was responsible for
							leading various activities for children and adults of all ages both day and residential, as
							an example these included groups of school children, children’s parties and cooperate team
							building events. This has enabled me to gain a wide experience in customer service. One of
							my main responsibilities as an instructor was to have a high regard for health and safety.
							The activities I led included working at heights, speed (up to 30 MPH), and on water. <br> I have also run freelance kayaking session at Foxlease Girlguiding Activity Centre, where I had to plan, and lead sessions for up to 12 children in kayaks and canoes.
